# CS-210---Project-One
Project One - Programming Languages (C++)

Q: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  A: Project One focuses on a company called Chada Tech. Chada Tech has an opening for a role as a junior developer. After applying for the position, Chada Tech requests that you complete a coding skills test as part of the interview process for the role. This coding skills test involes creating two clocks, a 12-hour clock and a 24-hour clock, to display on Chada Tech's website for their clients to view. When using this program, user should be able to input data which would simultaneously display both clocks for the user to view.

Q: What did you do particularly well?
  A: Per my instructor's feedback, my code looked good and was well written. My 12-hour clocks functionality was great! As was my error trap for invalid input.

Q: Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  A: My code was well written and looked good, but there was some lack in the functionality. More testing and bug-fixes would make my code and programs more efficient and secure. 

Q: Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  A: When building the two clocks, my display for the 12-hour clock was great. But there was missing logic to display the 24-hour clock, so that is not visable when using the program. As my first project using C++, I could've spent more time testing the program and code, and also could've reached out for assistance if needed. I havent used it for this class, but online tutoring is super helpful as well and I could've benefited from using that resource.

Q: What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  A: As this was my first project in this course, it was definitely helpful to learn to create code and test out the functionality. This helped me in my other projects or this class to remember to spend extra time testing code if need be to make sure the functionality is good.

Q: How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  A: I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by testing the code, performing bug-fixes and checking for errors, and making sure all of the necessary classes and details were in the code throughout.
